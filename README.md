# Langchain LLM Apps - Learning Journey
!(img header.png)
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my learning journey with the [Langchain framework](https://langchain.com/) and Krish Naik Sir Course. This repo will contain my experiments, projects, and notes as I explore and understand how to build LLM-powered applications using Langchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

This repository will include:
- **Learning Resources:** Notes and references I find helpful while learning Langchain.
- **Sample Applications:** Code for various LLM apps built using Langchain.
- **Experimentation:** Different ways to use Langchain for integrating LLMs into various use cases, including chatbots, automation, and more.

## üîç What is Langchain?

Langchain is a framework designed to make it easier to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It helps in managing the complexities of LLMs, such as chaining calls to language models, managing interactions, and deploying them in various environments. Langchain Framework provides services like-
- `LangSmith` : monitoring of llm apps.
- `LangServe`
- `LangGraph`
- `Agents`
- `Retrival` etc.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `apps/`: Applications built using Langchain, covering different use cases.

## üöÄ Projects and Applications

### 1. Conversational Q&A Chatbot Using Ollama (LLaMA3.1 8B Parameter Model)
![Ollama Langchain App](ollama%20app1/1_ollama_langchain_app.png)

Implemented a simple LLaMA3.1 chatbot using the Langchain framework. Learned how to use models from Ollama and monitored it through Langsmith.

- Folder: `ollama app1/`


*More projects to come as I progress.*

## üìö Resources

Here are some resources I find helpful in learning Langchain:
- [Langchain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/)
- [Langchain GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
